# [safeLink]()

### Welcome 👨‍💻

thanks for checking out my first chrome extension!

## Overview

### The main subject

main subject was to develop my first chrome extension, which would be able to catch any link on the page, and then check if it's safe throught google api, eventually set color that user declare for safeLink, and unSafeLink

## My process

### Built with

- HTML, CSS, JS
- Safe browsing google api

### What I learned

- sending HTTP POST request, and validating it

### What may be added

- add some database or data comming from api to expand google database (which isn't that big ;D) https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/
- even better emphasis of danger link in css
- searching not only for hrefs but other normal text that is written by someone
- api requests may be on the background.js side

## How to use

just clone code to new folder and then add it into Chrome Extension in dev mode
